# raster_animation

This project is geo-processing of NAIP imagery to produce timeseries animation of the ndvi values over an area of interest (aoi), leveraging Arcpy and other python libraries. The National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) offers aerial photography in four spectral bands (R, G, B, IR) with a spatial resolution of 0.6m. This work  encompasses downloading time-series NAIP raster, re-projection, clip, ndvi analysis, and finally creating timeloop animation.
